    It was never fully baked, nor was it secure, nor does it compile cleanly
    with -Wall, nor does it provide any useful examples for working with
    opensrf, etc.  Time to clear out.  So long, chopchop.

    Protect against empty/invalid log_protect sections
    
    Connectivity would fail if the log_protect section of opensrf_core.xml
    was empty, or contained only comments, as it does in the default
    example. Add a simple guard against this potential problem.  This fix
    will also protect against cases where the 'log_protect' section
    contains text rather than separate configuration elements.

    Consolidate duplicate osrfMethodVerifyContext handler
    
    Log redaction was not occuring in some cases because the code was using
    the OSRF_METHOD_VERIFY_CONTEXT macro instead of the similarly named
    function which does the same thing.  This change points the macro at the
    function so that all code uses the same underlying code.
    
    Note this change turns on CALL param logging unconditionally, whereas
    users of the macro would previously have been able to avoid CALL logging
    via the OSRF_LOG_PARAMS variable.  In practice, little code uses the
    macro and all code enables OSRF_LOG_PARAMS.  If we need to add this
    control back, it can be added directly to osrfMethodVerifyContext().
    For now, it's one less env variable we need to define.

    Log redaction for sensitive input values, Perl side
    
    This commit attempts to do the same as the C log redaction fix,
    but now at the Perl level.  The Perl configuration code was a
    little more crufty than the C side, so an additional feature was
    added to Config.pm to support the new 'shared' section.  At some
    point we should consider a ground-up rewrite of Config.pm, as the
    code seems to suffer some from its INI file roots.

    Log redaction for sensitive input values, C side
    
    Some service/methods deal with sensitive information (passwords,
    financial, etc.).  All input values (e.g. gateway method params)
    are currently logged in the activity log regardless of your log
    level.  This commit will allow you to redact the params of any
    method which matches a configurable set of left-anchored string
    values.
    
    This commit adds the initial config, and covers redaction of method
    parameters sent through the gateway, the translator, and more general
    OpenSRF C applications.

    Remove the reference to Evergreen in the README
    
    Stephen Wills reported problems installing Evergreen because of missing
    dependencies, and reading the OpenSRF README shows that it refers to the
    Evergreen prerequisite installer in a confusing way that might lead to
    users using only the Evergreen Makefile.install, rather than using the
    OpenSRF Makefile.install.
    
    In addition, Fedora 16 is going to be out of support soon, and Fedora 17
    and 18 are well-tested targets now.

    Add "tar" to base prereqs to appease autotools
    
    On a minimal install of Fedora 17, I was running into the perplexing
    error message whilst running 'autoreconf -i':
    
    libtoolize: can not copy `/usr/share/libtool/config/ltmain.sh' to `./'
    
    This was confusing because a manual copy would, in fact, copy the file
    just fine.
    
    http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libtool/2009-07/msg00030.html finally
    lead to enlightenment: autotools uses "tar" to copy files, not "cp".
    Thus, to avoid similar head-scratching install problems in the future,
    add "tar" to the base prerequisites for building OpenSRF (both to the
    DEBs list and the RPMs list).

    Minor cleanups to Java dependency build process
    
    While configure.ac still hardcodes the expected location of the Java
    dependencies (JSON and Memcached classes), we can clean up some of the
    lower-level challenges with the Java build.
    
    * StAX and WSTX were rolled into the core Java environment long ago,
      so there's no need to download them and even less need to verify
      that the downloaded version exist.
    * The Memcached class is now up to 2.0.1, per deps.sh, but the deps.inc
      file was pointing at 1.5.1.
    * Speaking of the deps.inc file, nothing seems to use it; delete it.
    * The Makefile was dying because the variables for the Memcached and
      JSON classes weren't defined. Define those at the top of the Makefile.

    Change Java deps.sh to include . in CLASSPATH
    
    Following the directions given by running deps.sh was a little bit
    frustrating; we need to work in some documentation on how to use the
    Java bits of OpenSRF - and perhaps look at a more standard option like
    maven for dependencies.

    Java HTTP gateway interface
    
    Supports sync and async requests.  Async requests support onResponse,
    onComplete, and onError handlers.
    
    Supports a max-threads value to limit the number of activately
    communicating threads over any connection.  When max-threads is reached,
    requests are queued and delivered as soon as there is room.
    
    Note that since this is talking to the OpenSRF gateway and not the
    translater, responses are simply collected and passed one at a time to
    onResponse.  They are not streamed.  The goal of supporting onResponse
    is to provide the same client API for both the gateway and translator.

    Protect gateway from format-string crashes in data
    
    As a common security measure, printf-style formatting codes are
    not allowed to be directly interpreted from a writable segment.
    The gateway code currently has the following function call:
    
    osrfLogActivity( OSRF_LOG_MARK, act->buf );
    
    This is a variadic function which expects the 'act->buf' position
    to contain a format string and any trailing arguments to be the
    values passed to the formatter.  Since act->buf is the value of
    what we passed in, some data inadvertantly contains format strings,
    and since it is a writable segment, the program crashes.  Here is
    an example of a crash-causing call:
    
    http://localhost/osrf-gateway-v1?service=test&method=test&param=%22%251n%22
    
    The param is interpreted as "%1n" and abruptly fails.
    
    The simple solution is to include a formatter so that our param gets
    demoted to being mere data, i.e.:
    
    osrfLogActivity( OSRF_LOG_MARK, "%s", act->buf );

    Perl pipe reading overhaul : data size header
    
    The lockfile mechanism for preventing premature end of reads on child
    processes suffers from one serious flaw:  if the data to write exceeds
    the pipe buffer size, the parent will block on syswrite and the service
    will lock up.  It's also not as effecient (for the normal case) as the
    code was without the lockfile, becasue the writes and reads are
    serialized.
    
    This commit replaces the lockfile mechanism with a protocol header in
    the data.  The first X (currently 12) bytes of data written to the child
    process will contain the full length of the data to be written (minus
    the header size).  The child now reads the data in parallel with the parent as
    data is available.  If the child reads all available data (in the pipe)
    but not all of the expected data, the child will go back into a select()
    wait pending more data from the parent.  The process continues until all
    data is read.
    
    This same mechanism is already used to commicate status info from child
    processes to the parent.

    Sync parent/child write/read with lock file
    
    Wrap parent writes to child socket and initial child reads of the
    socket in file lock (via flock()) to prevent rare race condition
    where child process reads to the end of the data before the parent

    Update Perl OpenSRF build and tests for O:A:Validator
    
    Kickstarted by wanting to bring OpenSRF::Application::Validator into the
    MANIFEST and testing coverage, I noticed a few other files that needed
    to be added to the MANIFEST as well. This gets us closer to acceptable
    according to "./Build distcheck"

    OpenSRF Validator Service
    
    Add a new Validator service, and EmailAddress validators.
    
    The service runs a chain of one or more validators, each one being fed the
    normalized output of the previous one.
    
    The return from each validator should be a hash of valid (0 or 1), the new
    normalized output (the untouched input if invalid or nothing needed to be
    changed), and if invalid an error string. Optionally, a validator can also
    include an "additionals" hash of extra information to be included in the
    final response.
    
    The complete list of validators included is:
    
    OpenSRF::Application::Validator::Base
        The base validator. Always returns valid.
    OpenSRF::Application::Validator::Invalid
        Always returns invalid for testing purposes.
    OpenSRF::Application::Validator::EmailAddress::Regex
        Does a very basic regular expression check on email addresses.
    OpenSRF::Application::Validator::EmailAddress::DNS
        Uses Net::DNS to look up the domain on an email address

    Add explicit chown command to README
    
    Warren Layton noticed that there was no explicit command to change the
    ownership of the files in the /<PREFIX> directory to be owned by
    "opensrf", although there was a statement that the files needed to be
    owned by "opensrf". To reduce the chance of failure, add the explicit
    command.
    
    TODO (for a willing volunteer): teach the installer to change the
    ownership at the time the files are installed!

    Add SIGPIPE retry handling to child data sysread
    
    Similar to the SIGPIPE retry logic wrapped around the parent process'
    syswrite call (for sending data to a child process), protect the child's
    sysread call (as it reads data from the parent).  In pre-2.0, the
    sysread step was handled by Net::Server, but now we need to protect it
    ourselves.

    Warn when sending very large messages
    
    Depending on configuration, messages of a certain size sent through a
    Jabber server will cause the jabber server to disconnect the client.
    This change allows admins to configure a message size warning threshold.
    When a message meets or exceeds the size threshold, a warning is issued
    to the logs with the message size (in bytes) and the message recipient.
    It does not prevent the message from being delivered.  It's purely
    informational.
    
    Use 1 800 000 as the default threhold.
