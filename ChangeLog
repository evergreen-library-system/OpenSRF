    LP#2047662: prefer real client IP for websocket activity logging
    
    This patch grabs the real client IP address (as set by in the
    X-Forwarded-For header following the stock reverse proxy configs
    and mapped to the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR environment variable by
    websocketd). If that header is not available, either because a
    proxy isn't be used or because X-Forwarded-To isn't being set, revert
    to REMOTE_ADDR.
    
    This allows better tracing of requests coming through the WebSockets
    gateway.
