    LP#2047662: prefer real client IP for websocket activity logging
    
    This patch grabs the real client IP address (as set by in the
    X-Forwarded-For header following the stock reverse proxy configs
    and mapped to the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR environment variable by
    websocketd). If that header is not available, either because a
    proxy isn't be used or because X-Forwarded-To isn't being set, revert
    to REMOTE_ADDR.
    
    This allows better tracing of requests coming through the WebSockets
    gateway.

    LP2054842: Add support for Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat
    
    Update Makefile.install prerequisites and README for Ubuntu 24.04
    Noble Numbat.
    
    This back port to the OpenSRF 3.3 series does not remove installation
    on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa.  We normally only support 2 active Ubuntu
    releases at a time.  This branch/commit makes an exception because the
    release team does not want to force an OpenSRF upgrade for the planned
    Evergreen 3.14.0 release.  This branch provides a stop gap for that.
