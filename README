README for OpenSRF 2.0.2
========================

Preamble: referenced user accounts
----------------------------------

In subsequent sections, we will refer to a number of different accounts, as
follows:

  * Linux user accounts:
    ** The *user* Linux account is the account that you use to log onto the
       Linux system as a regular user.
    ** The *root* Linux account is an account that has system administrator
       privileges. On Debian and Fedora you can switch to this account from
       your *user* account by issuing the `su -` command and entering the
       password for the *root* account when prompted. On Ubuntu you can switch
       to this account from your *user* account using the `sudo su -` command
       and entering the password for your *user* account when prompted.
    ** The *opensrf* Linux account is an account that you will create as part
       of installing OpenSRF. You can switch to this account from the *root*
       account by issuing the `su - opensrf` command.

Installing prerequisites
------------------------

OpenSRF has a number of prerequisite packages that must be installed
before you can successfully configure, compile, and install OpenSRF.
On Debian and Ubuntu, the easiest way to install these prerequisites
is to use the Makefile.install prerequisite installer for Evergreen.

Issue the following commands as the root user to install prerequisites
using the Makefile.install prerequisite installer, substituting your
operating system identifier for <osname> below:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
aptitude install make
make -f src/extras/Makefile.install <osname>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well-tested values for <osname> include:

  * `debian-lenny` for Debian 5.0
  * `debian-squeeze` for Debian 6.0.0
  * `ubuntu-hardy` for Ubuntu 8.04
  * `ubuntu-lucid` for Ubuntu 10.04
  * `ubuntu-precise` for Ubuntu 12.04
  * `fedora` for Fedora 16

Less-tested values for <osname> include:

  * `centos` for CentOS 5
  * `rhel` for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5

Patches and suggestions for improvement from users of these distributions,
or others, are welcome!

When the prerequisite installer reaches the Perl module stage, you may 
be prompted for configuration of Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN)
on your server. You can generally accept the defaults by pressing <return>
for all of the prompts, except for the country configuration.

Preamble: Developer instructions
--------------------------------

[NOTE]
Skip this section if you are using an official release tarball downloaded
from http://evergreen-ils.org/downloads

Developers working directly with the source code from the Git repository,
rather than an official release tarball, must install some extra packages
and perform one step before they can proceed with the `./configure` step.

As the *root* Linux account, install the following packages:

  * autoconf
  * automake
  * libtool

As the *user* Linux account, issue the following command in the OpenSRF
source directory to generate the configure script and Makefiles:

[source, bash]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
./autogen.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration and compilation instructions
------------------------------------------

Use the `configure` command to configure OpenSRF, and the `make` command to
build OpenSRF. The default installation prefix (PREFIX) for OpenSRF is
`/opensrf/`.

If you are building OpenSRF for Evergreen, issue the following commands as
the *user* Linux account to configure and build OpenSRF:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
./configure --prefix=/openils --sysconfdir=/openils/conf
make
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, OpenSRF includes C, Perl, and JavaScript support.
You can add the `--enable-python` option to the configure command
to build Python support and `--enable-java` for Java support.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Once you have configured and compiled OpenSRF, issue the following
   command as the *root* Linux account to install OpenSRF:
+
[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
make install
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create and set up the opensrf Unix user environment
---------------------------------------------------

This user is used to start and stop all OpenSRF processes, and must own all
files contained in the PREFIX directory hierarchy. Issue the following
commands as the *root* Linux account to create the `opensrf` user and set up
its environment, substituting <PREFIX> with the value you passed to `--prefix`
in your configure command:

.Creating the `opensrf` user
[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
useradd -m -s /bin/bash opensrf
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/<PREFIX>/bin" >> /home/opensrf/.bashrc
passwd opensrf
chown -R opensrf:opensrf /<PREFIX>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Define your public and private OpenSRF domains
----------------------------------------------

For security purposes, OpenSRF uses Jabber domains to separate services
into public and private realms. Throughout these instructions, we will use
the example domains `public.localhost` and `private.localhost`. 

On a single-server system, the easiest way to define public and private
domains is to define separate hostnames by adding entries to the `/etc/hosts`
file. Here are entries that you could add to a stock `/etc/hosts` file for our
example domains:

.Example added entries for `/etc/hosts`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
127.0.1.2	public.localhost	public
127.0.1.3	private.localhost	private
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adjust the system dynamic library path
--------------------------------------

Add `<PREFIX>/lib/` to the system's dynamic library path, and then run
`ldconfig` as the *root* Linux account.

On Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora systems, run the following commands as the *root*
Linux account:

.Adjusting the system dynamic library path
[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
echo <PREFIX>/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opensrf.conf
ldconfig
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

On most other systems, you can add these entries to `/etc/ld.so.conf`, or
create a file within the `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/` directory, and then run
`ldconfig` as the *root* Linux account.

Configure the ejabberd server
-----------------------------

OpenSRF requires an XMPP (Jabber) server. For performance reasons, ejabberd is
the Jabber server of choice for the OpenSRF project. In most cases, you only
have to make a few changes to the default `ejabberd.cfg` file to make ejabberd
work for OpenSRF. 

1. Stop ejabberd before making any changes to its configuration by issuing the
   following command as the *root* Linux account:
+
.(Debian / Ubuntu) Stopping ejabberd
[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
/etc/init.d/ejabberd stop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
.(Fedora) Stopping ejabberd
[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
systemctl stop ejabberd.service
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
2. Open `/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg` and make the following
changes:
  a. Define your public and private domains in the `hosts` directive. For
   example:
+
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
{hosts, ["private.localhost", "public.localhost"]}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
  b. Comment out the `mod_offline` directive
  c. Increase the `max_user_sessions` value to 10000
  d. Change all `max_stanza_size` values to 2000000
  e. Change all `maxrate` values to 500000 
+
3. Restart the ejabberd server to make the changes take effect:
+
.(Debian / Ubuntu) Starting ejabberd
[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
/etc/init.d/ejabberd start
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
.(Fedora) Starting ejabberd
[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
systemctl start ejabberd.service
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create the OpenSRF Jabber users
-------------------------------

On each domain, you need two Jabber users to manage the OpenSRF communications:

  * a `router` user, to whom all requests to connect to an OpenSRF service
    will be routed; this Jabber user must be named `router`
  * an `opensrf` user, which clients use to connect to OpenSRF services; this
    user can be named anything you like

Create the Jabber users by issuing the following commands as the *root* Linux
account. Substitute `<password>` for your chosen passwords for each user
respectively:

.Creating the OpenSRF Jabber users
[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ejabberdctl register router private.localhost <password>
ejabberdctl register opensrf private.localhost <password>
ejabberdctl register router public.localhost <password>
ejabberdctl register opensrf public.localhost <password>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update the OpenSRF configuration files
--------------------------------------

There are two critical files that you must update to make OpenSRF work.
SYSCONFDIR is `/opensrf/etc` by default, or the value that you passed to
`--sysconfdir` during the configuration phase.

  * `SYSCONFDIR/opensrf.xml` - this file lists the services that this
    OpenSRF installation supports; if you create a new OpenSRF service,
    you need to add it to this file.
      * The `<hosts>` element at the bottom of the file lists the services
        that should be started for each hostname. You can force the system
        to use `localhost`, so in most cases you will leave this section
        as-is.
    
  * `SYSCONFDIR/opensrf_core.xml` - this file lists the Jabber connection
    information that will be used for the system, as well as determining
    logging verbosity and defining which services will be exposed on the
    HTTP gateway. There are four username/password pairs to update in this
    file:
      1. `<config><opensrf>` = use the private Jabber `opensrf` user
      2. `<config><gateway>` = use the public Jabber `opensrf` user
      3. `<config><routers><router>` = use the public Jabber `router` user
      4. `<config><routers><router>` = use the private Jabber `router` user

You should also create a `.srfsh.xml` file in the home directory of each user
that you want to enable to use the srfsh to communicate with OpenSRF services.

Copy `SYSCONFDIR/srfsh.xml.example` to `~/.srfsh.xml` and update the password 
to match the one for your Jabber `opensrf` user with the `private.localhost`
domain.

Starting and stopping OpenSRF services
--------------------------------------

To start all OpenSRF services with a hostname of `localhost`, issue the
following command as the *opensrf* Linux account:

[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
osrf_ctl.sh -l -a start_all
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To stop all OpenSRF services with a hostname of `localhost`, issue the
following command as the *opensrf* Linux account:

[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
osrf_ctl.sh -l -a stop_all
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing the default OpenSRF services
------------------------------------

By default, OpenSRF ships with an `opensrf.math` service that performs basic
calculations involving two integers. Once you have started the OpenSRF
services, test the services as follows:

1. Start the `srfsh` interactive OpenSRF shell by issuing the following
   command as the *opensrf* Linux account:
+
.Starting the `srfsh` interactive OpenSRF shell
[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
srfsh
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
2. Issue the following request to test the `opensrf.math` service:
+
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
srfsh# request opensrf.math add 2,2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
You should receive the value `4`.

Troubleshooting note for Python users
-------------------------------------

If you are running a Python client and trying to connect to OpenSRF running on
localhost rather than a hostname that can be resolved via DNS, you will
probably receive exceptions about `dns.resolver.NXDOMAIN`. If this happens,
you need to install the `dnsmasq` package, configure it to serve up a DNS
entry for localhost, and point your local DNS resolver to `dnsmasq`. For example,
on Ubuntu you can issue the following commands as the *root* Linux account:

.(Debian / Ubuntu) Installing and starting `dnsmasq`
[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
aptitude install dnsmasq
/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then edit `/etc/resolv.conf` and ensure that `nameserver 127.0.0.1` is the
first entry in the file.
